# GETTING STARTED
nOblivion is a platform which extracts and rewrites your memories. A memory has those main ingredients:
* a date (or at least a year)
* a category of "hobbies", "relationships", "travel", "business", "pets" or "childhood"
* 0 to 4 images which can be uploaded or taken as snapshots with the webcam
* a written or spoken memory which will be checked in the selected tone for the profile, the grammar will also be corrected
* an optional location like "NYC", "At home"
All memories are stored inside a knowledge graph which connects important events, persons, locations and so on.
The knowledge graph can be used to create a book (PDF) from the memories or the memories can be directly queried via a chatbot interface.
