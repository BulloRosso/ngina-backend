# Noblivion - Your experiences are precious
Noblivion is a AI system which helps you capturing your personal or professional experiences during various on-screen interviews. The empathetic AI interviewer guides you through the depths of your memories, captures them, gives them structure and finally ouputs them as a book in PDF format.

## How to get Noblivion?
Noblivion is a gift from children to their parents and the process starts when a person enters the personal data of another person (called the client from here) as profile in the Noblivion React frontend. This profile contains personal information and will help the AI interviewer to get started and to focus on the most relevant facets of the client.

## Process of the interviews
An interview can only start if a profileID (UUIDv4) is selected in the frontend. Then we change to the memory collection process:
* first initiate a new sessionID 
* every client input or ai output will be collected in a session object in the storage
* create an message to the client using AI giving some ideas what memories could be collected in this session
* receive on input item from the client which could be eiter text input multiline, audio recording from direct voice input, uploaded image file or image taken from the camera
* binary input items should be saved in object storage, text items should be stored directly in the session object, audio should be transcribed using openAI API and converted and saved as text item
* the backend extracts information for the knowledge graph using OpenAI entity extraction and appends the information (like relationships to persons, likes and dislikes of the client)
* the backend extracts timeline information using an OpenAI prompts and extends the timeline object with a reference to the input item (so the frontend can later display a link to the memory)
* the backend extracts the sentiment of the current user input by taking the last 4 user inputs as a reference and sends it back to the frontend (the frontend displays it as an icon)
* the backend constructs a reflection on the users input item with OpenAI and sends it back to the frontend (the frontend displays it and reads it as audio produced by a streaming OpenAI text synthesis call)
* the next input item is received until the user presses an "Leave/end interview session" in the frontend

## Capturing of memories of the client 
We want to capture and extract the following data from the interviews and arrange them in a structure.

For each memory which is received from the frontend by the backend it has to be analyzed in the following steps:

1. extract the point in time from the memory text using AI. If no point in time was found use today as timestamp.
2. store the memory with the point in time as formated text or as image resource
3. extract named entities and relationships from the memory text using AI
4. update the knowledge graph with named entities and relationships
5. query the knowledge graph with the first named entity to get information for the follow up question

### timeline
Each memory is assigned to a point in time and and optional location (e. g. "I met Kerstin on 22.02.1971 in Nürnberg, Germany")
### memory
The memory as a formatted text using markdown and optional images
### knowledge graph
The knowledge graph contains all relations between persons, locations, pets, houses/addresses and other entities which happened in the life of the client

## Technical parts of the Noblivion system

### Frontend: React, vite, mui v6 and Typescript
The frontend uses plaing mui v6 styling and is intended to used by non-trained users. Handling instructions and step-by-step guidance should always be provided.

#### App (entry point)
The app looks like this:
-------------------
{frontend_entrypoint}
-------------------

These are the libraries used by the app. Always prefer using an existing library/package to solve a problem rather than adding a new one:
--------------------
{frontend_packages}
--------------------

#### Components
These are the components we already have. You can modify them if you like:
--------------------
{frontend_components}
---------------------

### Services
These are the exitsing frontend services:
--------------
{frontend_services}
--------------

#### Types
These are the types which we use. They must be always in sync with the Python models in the Backend. If you want to add something always change the Python model
first and then the type definition in the frontend project:
------------------------
{frontend_types}
------------------------

#### Multi-language setup/i18n
You should not insert labels as plain text but always use the react-i18n-library:
---------------------
{frontend_i18n}
---------------------

### Backend: Python, FastAPI and Pydantic, neo4j knowledge graph
The backend exposes several API endpoints. Internally it uses models to maintain models.
These are the models:
----------------------
{backend_models}
----------------------
These are the endpoints:
----------------------
{backend_api_endpoints}
----------------------
When you change existing endpoints give a clear notice.

These are the exitsing backend services:
--------------
{backend_services}
--------------

This is the configuration of FASTAPI:
------------
{backend_entrypoint}
------------

### Storage Layer: Supabase
In Supabase we use the object storage to store binary files per client. In Supabase we use the table storage to retain memories, profiles and all other relevant data.
The unique identifier for an client is a UUIDv4. Each client can have several interview sessions.
This is the current schema in Supabase:
---------------
{storage_layer}
---------------
We will use the supabase Python client.

### AI models: OpenAI
The backend uses OpenAI API and langchain to send prompts to an AI.
